## For Video Dataset

We provide a video dataset processing recipe example for users to better utilize video-related OPs in [general-video-refine-example.yaml](general-video-refine-example.yaml). Here we apply three types of OPs:
- Text-Only: to improve the dataset quality according to the video captions.
- Video-Only: to improve the dataset quality according to the video features.
- Text-Video: to improve the dataset quality according to the alignment between text and videos.
Users can start to process their video datasets based on this recipe.
